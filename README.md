Study program for differentiation of equations (only for functions with one variable). 

Input equation is hardcoded in main.c right now. 
Output is pdf (created with LaTeX) and images with graphs structures of the input equation and the result of the differentiation of equation -- for debug.

LaTeX and Dot packages are required.
